# Risk-Adjusted-Return-with-Python
#### Calculation of Risk adjusted measures on a real data set using Python

So we have done the following in the notebook present in the repository:

1. We have dabbled on the calculation of annualised volatility for a sample data.
2. We imported a real life data set using pandas read_csv.
3. Computed Annualised returns and Annualised volatility.
4. Have then computed the Risk adjusted measures as in a Return/Risk ratio and Sharpe ratio.
